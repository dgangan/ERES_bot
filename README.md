# ERES Telegram Bot  

> **Status:** Early stage of development

Telegram Bot to notify for scheduled power outage of ERES electric power provider company (https://eres.md)  
Data collected by parsing scheduled outage pages published by provider: https://eres.md/abon/planotkl/3-planotkl  

Planning to have:
* Notification of outages for all the cities/villages once they've got published by supplier
* User customization to receive only notification for specific: region, city, street
* Possibility to receive repeated notification (e.g get notification once outage schedule published and repeat it 24h before outage)

Application is going to be deployed on [Oracle Cloud (free tier instance)](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/) and use [Oracle Autonomous Database](https://www.oracle.com/autonomous-database/)
